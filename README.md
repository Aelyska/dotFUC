# dotFUC
Horibbly ChatGPT-coded image-file protection software made in Python.
(This software is mainly satire and shouldn't be taken seriously.)

# Terminology
The official terminoloy for encrypting an image into FUC is called 'I am going to FUC this image.'

# Compatibility
Works on Windows 10 (I have not tested this on other operating systems, and it will definitely not work on Linux.)

# Special Thanks
Thanks to VWHL3 for beta-testing this wonderful pile of sweetness.
